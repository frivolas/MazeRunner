# MazeRunner

This is my Processing implementation for a depth-first recursive backtracker algorithm. It paints a grid of specific size and then carves a maze in it. The app finishes up by saving the image of the maze in a PDF file for you to print and play.

And many thanks to [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman) for his super [clear explanation](youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4) of the algorithm.

Dan's code in JavaScript where the language does a high level interpretation of the variable types. I had to figure out how to play with ArrayLists, indices, functions and booleans to get a similar result in Processing (Java).

I guess next steps are to put this applet in a website and make it public (_Maybe generate a random maze every day?_), and then write a maze solving algorithm.
